# Weekly Photo Gallery
Visit the site at: https://giancarlo-david.github.io/PhotoWeekly/

### Why create this?
I wanted to have a place to look back at my favorite pictures I've taken every week throughout a year. Not only would this let me reminisce on my memories from the year that has passed but it also pushes me to get out and continue my hobby of photography.

### Feedback
Feel free to check it out and provide any feedback (good or bad) about any of the pictures posted
